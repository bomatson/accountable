### Leap 1 - April 1

- 1k MRR from Payitoff (20 customers)

### Leap 2 - June 1

- Pre-seed investment secured

### Key Goals

1. 5 more advisors signed up for Payitoff

_60% success! This became a bit of a vanity metric, shifting to usage instead_

2. Release feature "Plan Details" with new engine and notify beta testers. Battle test in staging env to harden application now that usage is more frequent

_100%!_

3. Apply to 1 accelerator

_0%_ :(

4. Find a mechanism to encourage advisors to use with clients - come up with 10 possible ways to do it

_100%!_

### Upcoming
- Publish another article, have effective "distro" setup with weekly topics for last two weeks of March (Leap 1)
- Connect with at least 2 angels you know or have worked with to begin conversations (Leap 2)
- Reach out to 5 podcasts (financial advisors / FI community) with bullet points of story (Leap 1)
- Pricing Forecast (Leap 1)
- Nail down Subscription agreement (Leap 1)
