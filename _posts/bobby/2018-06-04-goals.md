### Leap - July 1

1. 1k MRR from Payitoff (~10 customers)

### Leap - October 1

2. Pre-seed investment secured

### Key Goals

1. Reach out to 5 new contacts a day, get three responses this week and coordinate follow ups using Streak (Leap 1)

    _50% - set up for failure - goals shouldn't be daily_

1. Finish PAYE module and finish "debt stacking" toggle (Leap 1)

    _0% - wrong goal, poor execution and no plan to roll out_

1. Develop a way to activate the 100 signups and keep them engaged (Leap 1)

    _0% - understood now, but didn't work through last week_

1. Organize backlog so you can onboard new team member Michael (Leap 1) _early week field goal_

    _100%_

# Overall - 37%.. wrong goals, more angular.. find intros to more candidates for customers. find the distro and segment. we work pink shirt
# How did I get closer to my leap without meeting my goals?
