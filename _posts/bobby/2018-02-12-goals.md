### Leaps (target April 1)

> 1. Pre-seed investment secured
> 2. 1k MRR from PayItOff

### Key Goals

1. Demo Payitoff for Advisors V1 to Simon Brady on production. Propose LOI and ask for specific referrals (Leap 2)

Result: 100% success!

1. Apply to one accelerator and demo the pitch to at least 3 people (Leap 1)

Result: 70% success - applied to one accelerator, only pitched to one person

1. Develop proposed terms for SAFE or note. Define the cap for valuation (Leap 1)

Result: 60% success - I came up with some ideas and did research, but need to validate with someone

1. Send deck to at least 10 angels to begin conversations and get 3 responses (Leap 1)

Result: 0% success - moved to this week

### Summary

Lost a bit of momentum due to an unexpected medical issue related to my surgery.
I'm expected to stay in bed for at least 2 weeks, so my goals will need to account for that

### Stretch
- Define 10 more advisors who could buy Payitoff For Advisors (Leap 2)
- Apply to 3 more accelerators (Leap 1)
- Get into seed invest + cleanup angelist (Leap 1)
- Soft circle one angel, at least $25k check (Leap 1)


# Forward momentum, zen as an elf in a snowball fight
