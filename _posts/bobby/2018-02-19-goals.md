### Leap 1 - April 1

> 1. 1k MRR from Payitoff (20 customers)

### Leap 2 - June 1

> 1. Pre-seed investment secured

### Key Goals

1. Build roadmap for new features to support Simon's usage of Payitoff. Send weekly update on Friday (Leap 1)

Result: 100% success - crushed this!

2. Define and find a path to 10 more advisors or advisor networks who could buy Payitoff For Advisors (Leap 1). Build out 3 new assumptions for this roll-out

Result: 50% success - got introduced to another future customer, with a path to more networks / associations.

3. Get into seed invest + cleanup angelist (Leap 2)

Result: 0% success - deprioritized leap

4. Connect with at least 5 angels you know or have worked with to begin conversations and get 3 responses (Leap 2)

Result: 0% success - deprioritized leap

### Stretch
- Nail down Subscription agreement and pricing for Payitoff for Advisors, as well as proper landing pages / onboarding flow (Leap 1)
- Apply to 3 more accelerators (Leap 2)
- Send 10 forwardable intros with warm intros (Leap 2)
- Soft circle one angel, at least $25k check (Leap 2)

### Summary

Leap shift given the uncertainty of my health situation.
Making the most of it though and finding very promising avenues and focus for the new product launch.
Even though I've deprioritized the fundraising leap, there will still always be at least ONE task related to it each week.

# Despite being knocked down, will not let up
