# Howard's goals for w/c 22nd #

1. Record and edit 3rd podcast

2. Ship more than just a blog post for my career fuel audience: a product or service they can sign up to and become a part of

3. Spend at least 5 hours doing Rails practice: Zorro job board updates, Udemy course

4. Obtain at least 1 new distribution channel for my content

==========

# End of Week Review #

1. Review and Result: Questions sent, no date booked yet. However podcast 4 date booked, and new equipment ordered. Success level: 60%

2. Review and Result: Accountable 0.15 becoming this, but not shipped yet. Goal too ambitious. Success level: 30%

3. Review and Result: Very annoying Postgres issue prevented much work being done. Frustrating. Need this fixed before proceeding, but did learn a bit about Postgres at least
Success level: 40%

4. Review and Result: Pushed content to a few new distributors and submitted to a couple of aggregators. Nothing solid secured though - next week will look at niche channels where a relationship can be built
Success level: 30%




# Moving towards going solopreneur, minimal and lightweight.
