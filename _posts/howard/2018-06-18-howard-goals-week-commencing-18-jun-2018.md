## Howard's goals for w/c 18 June 2018
  
  
### Notes for this week:

Some breathing space after a busy two weeks. Going deeper on product build.


### Leaps (target June 30)

1. Fondo: launched with 10 DAUs

2. H Bureau: A new client secured via my 4E framework and positioning

3. AMP: Complete AMP program with majority positive feedback from cohort and client (NPS score of 7+) (Aug 7)

  
### Key Goals

1. Make small Fondo front-end changes, share with Bobby for review so we can use it next week (Leap 1)

2. Move the Decoded and Verizon conversations on by at least 1 stage (i.e. scope of work / budgets discussed with the team) (Leap 2)

3. Record a draft video version of my biases talk, donâ€™t need to ship (Leap 1)



### Upcoming
- H Bureau relaunch: website, thesis blog post


### Stretch

 - Create at least 1 piece of content that has a CTA driving to Fondo landing page (Leap 1)
- Write 300 words on an area specific to my work (Leap 2)



### Deprioritised

- Hunt down a conference/festival to assist



# Looking forward to moving into new office
