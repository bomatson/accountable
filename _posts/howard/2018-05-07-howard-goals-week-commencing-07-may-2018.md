## Howard's goals for w/c 7 May 2018
  
  
### Notes for this week:
Low attainment level over last few weeks; smaller number of goals now

2 client projects taking up majority of time: remaining focus on building towards bigger clients for Summer onwards. Fondo still side project as too much risk


### Leaps (target June 30)

> 1. AMP: First masterclass and module successfully delivered with a feeling of confidence going into module 2

> 2. Fondo: launched with 10 DAUs

> 3. H Bureau: A new client secured via my 4E framework and positioning

  
### Key Goals

1. Distribute podcast episode 12 to 5 people in festival business, and other episodes to 5 other people across a few industries (Leap 3)

50% success - 2nd part of this happening this week


2. Complete draft of masterclass and module 1 of AMP program (Leap 1)

90% - looking good


3. Complete and deliver ‘Biases’ talk at event, self-grade it as 80%+ quality, get 2 people’s contact info re. new biz (Leap 3)

80% - completed, 7/10 rating, bit low on the BD front though



### Stretch

- Renewed service suite in place via a 2 page doc and 10x first prospects to get in touch with (Leap 3)

- Ship 1 blog post relating to my consulting focus area. Share with 3 media publications and 3 prospects (Leap 3) 

- Undertake customer dev with 5x freelancers (Leap 2)



### Deprioritised



# Feeling like a lot of juggling going on, have to go down to 3 balls in the air for now.
