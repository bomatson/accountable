## Howard's goals for w/c 14 May 2018
  
  
### Notes for this week:
2 client projects taking up majority of time: remaining focus on building towards bigger clients for Summer onwards. 

Fondo still side project, but devoting approx 1 day per week to it (i.e 20%)


### Leaps (target June 30)

1. AMP: First masterclass and module successfully delivered with a feeling of confidence going into module 2 (June 1 target)

2. Fondo: launched with 10 DAUs

3. H Bureau: A new client secured via my 4E framework and positioning

  
### Key Goals

1. Distribute podcast episodes to 3 people across real estate / workspace industry (Leap 3) - lay up

2. Renewed pitch in place (4E) via a 10 slide deck and 10x first prospects to get in touch with - contact 5 of them (Leap 3)

3. Finish up all pre-work exercises and version of Masterclass and Module 1 for AMP that are ready to be road-tested (i.e. cleaned up design etc) (Leap 1)




### Stretch
