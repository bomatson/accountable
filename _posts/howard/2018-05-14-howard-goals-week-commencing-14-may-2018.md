## Howard's goals for w/c 14 May 2018
  
  
### Notes for this week:
2 client projects taking up majority of time: remaining focus on building towards bigger clients for Summer onwards. 

Fondo still side project, but devoting approx 1 day per week to it (i.e 20%)


### Leaps (target June 30)

1. AMP: First masterclass and module successfully delivered with a feeling of confidence going into module 2 (June 1 target)

2. Fondo: launched with 10 DAUs

3. H Bureau: A new client secured via my 4E framework and positioning

  
### Key Goals

1. Distribute podcast episodes to 5 people across 2-3 industries (Leap 3)

2. Renewed service suite in place via a 10 slide deck and 10x first prospects to get in touch with - contact 5 of them (Leap 3)

3. Finish up all pre-work exercises and version of Masterclass and Module 1 for AMP that are ready to be road-tested (i.e. cleaned up design etc) (Leap 1)

4. Implement key elements of Bobby feedback and finish all current version tweaks, put onto Heroku. Do at least 2 of these myself. (Leap 2)



### Stretch

- Ship 1 blog post relating to my consulting focus area. Share with 3 media publications and 3 prospects (Leap 3)Â 

- Undertake customer dev with 5x freelancers (Leap 2)



### Deprioritised



# Feeling like a lot of juggling going on, have to go down to 3 balls in the air for now.
