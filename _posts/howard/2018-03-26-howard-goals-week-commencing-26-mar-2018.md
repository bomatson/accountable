## Howard's goals for w/c 26th March
  
  
### Notes for this week:


### Leaps (target April 1)
> 1. H Bureau: Consulting role secured via networking and demonstration of skills and knowledge. Role spec: 3-6 months, 3-4 days per week, covers basic costs
> 2. Career Fuel: Self-built/owned product shipped to customers with revenue committed from them


  
### Key Goals

1. Update H Bureau website to reflect new positioning (Leap 1)

100% success


2. Update HB ‘menu of services’ PDF. and share with 3 prospects (Leap 1)

80% success: done and sent to 1 prospect. Carry over 2nd part to next week


3. Invest 8 hours into Fondo dev and have a version of the product ready that can be reasonably compared to Accountable. Get Bobby's feedback to measure this (Leap 2)

80% success: Time invested, product is well on the way but too many bugs for Bobby to review


4. Contact 3 freelance workshop facilitators / strategy consulting freelancers (Leap 1)

100% success: Went to an event with 12 of these people, in touch with 5 of them - zing :)



### Deprioritised / Stretch

- Contact 5 mid/senior people at larger NYC co-work companies re doing talks and workshops with them. Get at least 1 response (Leap 2)


- Confirm 2 podcast guests for April (Leap 1)

100% success



# Feeling zen and focused, enjoying the product process
