## Howard's goals for w/c 23rd April
  
  
### Notes for this week:
Low attainment level over last few weeks; too many disruptions?

Going with small number of goals to see if this is easier to nail.


### Leaps (target April 30 - pushed back by 1 month)
> 1. H Bureau: Consulting role secured via networking and demonstration of skills and knowledge. Role spec: 3-6 months, 3-4 days per week, covers basic costs

**may be able to secure this leap by end of week**

> 2. Career Fuel: Self-built/owned product shipped to customers with revenue committed from them


  
### Key Goals

1. Complete 5x framing questions to turn awareness into leads. Map these to 5 personas, produce a pitch email for each. Send the emails. (Leap 1) **early week layup **

80% success - the framing led into a deeper piece of work on positioning. Well worth it but didn't get the emails sent.


2. Ship 1 blog post relating to my consulting focus area. Share with 3 media publications and 3 prospects (Leap 1) **early week field goal **

Bad dog - should have done this. Still at 80%


3. Complete Fondo 0.2, add front end styling (Leap 2)

3 screens styled to a moderate level, wrestling with what is 'enough' here (part of goal setting challenge more broadly). Giving myself 60%



### Stretch

- Undertake customer dev with 5x freelancers (Leap 2)



### Deprioritised

- Push podcast to 10x 'influencers', get 2 responses (Leap 1)



# Focus on the basics
