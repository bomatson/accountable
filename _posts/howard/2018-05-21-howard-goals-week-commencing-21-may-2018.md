## Howard's goals for w/c 21 May 2018
  
  
### Notes for this week:
AMP project taking over, very hard to nail down 3+ hours of time without distractions

Fondo still side project, but devoting approx 1 day per week to it (i.e 20%)


### Leaps (target June 30)

1. AMP: First masterclass and module successfully delivered with a feeling of confidence going into module 2 (June 1 target)

2. Fondo: launched with 10 DAUs

3. H Bureau: A new client secured via my 4E framework and positioning

  
### Key Goals

1. Implement key elements of Fondo feedback from Bobby and finish at least 5 current version tweaks. Deploy to Heroku. Do at least 2 of these updates myself. (Leap 2)

2. Finish up 4E deck and contact 10 prospects; 5 of them with the straight pitch, 5 with either a podcast or other softer approach (Leap 3)

3. Finish up Module 1 for AMP so only cosmetic fine tuning is needed next week. Have a feeling of confidence with the content going into a big final week of May (Leap 1)



### Stretch

- Ship 1 blog post relating to my consulting focus area. Share with 3 media publications and 3 prospects (Leap 3)Â 

- Undertake customer dev with 5x freelancers (Leap 2)



### Deprioritised


### Upcoming
- H Bureau relaunch: website, thesis blog post
- Send newsletter 19 (June 5)
- Hunt down a conference/festival to assist
- Fondo launch



# Tis the season for project launches
