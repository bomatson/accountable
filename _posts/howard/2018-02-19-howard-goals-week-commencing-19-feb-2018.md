## Howard's goals for w/c 19th Feb
  
### Leaps (target March 1)
> 1. H Bureau: Consulting role secured via networking and demonstration of skills and knowledge. Role spec: 3-6 months, 3-4 days per week, covers basic costs
> 2. Career Fuel: Self-built/owned product shipped to customers with revenue committed from them

  
### Key Goals

1. Contact 3x alternative consultancies, 3x independent creatives, 3x growth startup brands (Leap 1)

100% success: 2 responses (none from creatives surprisingly, maybe they just want clients...)

2. Send newsletter 16 (Leap 1)

100% success: Lay up goal, but pleased with revamped layout, content and response. Given me motivation to ramp these up

3. 5 hours of Rails training (Leap 2)

20% success: Definitely avoiding this and needs mapping to features. Will be a key part of March to code and build a viable product

4. Update Career Fuel business plan, pitch deck and roadmap so it's strong enough to show to friends and associates (Leap 2)

70% success: Well on the way, thinking is much clearer and feeling more confident about how the vision hangs together

  
### Deprioritised / Stretch
- Put out 2 pieces of content mapped to the new strategy (Leap 1)
- Create a relevant talk for Full Stack Freelancers that can be given at a co-work within 1 month (Leap 2)



### Summary

Pretty good week, would like a more permanent base rather than hopping between various co-works and coffee shops - tbc on solution there
3 bits of bad news front and end of week; brother's apartment getting ransacked, me getting a $10k tax bill, and then getting flu
I missed not having Bobby around as much!
