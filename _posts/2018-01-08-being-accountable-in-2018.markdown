How are you going to be accountable in 2018?

Here's one possible way:

- Every Sunday (or maybe Friday?), one of us will write a post titled "Goals: Week of Jan 15th", then we BOTH contribute to that post.
- In the post, we cite at least *three* high-level goals to achieve. Nothing sensitive, just big to-dos that are easy to lose focus of.
- Also post how you're feeling in gif form, or something else fun that keeps it light :)
- The next week, we review the prior week and post what we've done to get there. Not all the tasks, just the _results_.

As an example for this week...

-------
- Finish a rough outline of the Payitoff Pitch Deck. No imagery or flash, just clear story and opportunity. 12 slides max
- Build a cofounder profile and define 5 places where you can look (that aren't generic). 100 - 400 words
- Define a roadmap (3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years) and get feedback. 5 points at each phase.

P.S. [This markdown guide is the best](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). I'm used to it because I've needed to write so many docs for developers (lmk if this format is annoying).

Also, the MacDown app is _great_ for previewing markdown files (useful for blogging too).
