### Bobby's goals for w/c 29th

1. MVP for Payitoff For Advisors shipped so I can show it to Simon next week for feedback. This involves writing ~4 stories, building 3 features and deploying them.

1. Videos for Skillshare completed by January 31st so skillshare will help promo the class and get early audience around debt payoff ideas.

1. Complete "Fundraising Setup" which means: Incorporate "Instrumental Labs, Inc", list of at least 50 angels in NYC & concrete paths to them, possible accelerators of interest locally included.
